# Autonomous Car with Obstacle Avoidance 
## Introduction:
Senior Project Android Studio project for an Android mobile application to interface with a remote autonomous car through a Raspberry Pi hub of communication. 
## Get Started: 
The project is made up of 3 subsystems: The Android Phone, The Arduino Board, and the Raspberry Pi. The setup for these 3 subsystems are listed separately below. 
### Android Mobile Application 
* First copy the project link from Github and clone it. 
* Open Android Studio and Import the Android Studio project folder from within the directory of the project you just cloned. 
* Once the Gradle has finished building, you may run the project to a local emulator or to a connected device. 
* Voila, the Mobile end of the Autonomous Car project has been completed! 
### Raspberry Pi Setup

### Arduino Setup

## Finishing Touches
The project is not fully functional as of 6/9/2019, but is very close to completion! All that remains is the completion of the obstacle avoidance algorithm and the control system algorithm to allow for straight driving. All information on the project can be found within the Resources folder under *TechnicalReport.pdf*.
