#IOT with Raspberry PI and Android ( control LEDs remotely )
## Introduction:
IOT is a concept that provides a link for an object (sensors, lamps, â€¦Etc) or a systems as HVAC or lighting systems to the Internet. It extends the connectivity of the Internet beyond PCs, tablets and smart phones to others devices which are not considered smart. 

Briefly, we assign an IP to things to communicate with them either for control or monitoring. In this instance, I used my android tablet to control 3 LEDs attached to raspberry pi GPIOs via Sockets using Java.

Of causer this is a simple prototype but you can build a cool things on it.
